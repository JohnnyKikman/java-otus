Best latency:
1. Parallel
2. G1
3. ZGC
4. Serial

Best throughput:
1. G1
2. ZGC
3. Parallel
4. Serial

Notes:
1. Serial GC has the lowest CPU consumption and GC usage
2. Despite generally inferior stats, serial GC ultimately works longer than other GCs (at least, on my laptop)
3. Parallel collectors have better latency
4. ZGC seems to optimize itself to work like Serial on my setup (otherwise it doesn't make sense in real environment)
5. ZGC/G1 have higher footprint than parallel (of concurrent GC)
